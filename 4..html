            JavaScript is considered an interpreted language because the code is executed line by line by an interpreter at runtime. 
            This means that when a browser runs a JavaScript script, it reads and executes the code directly, 
            without needing to compile it into machine language beforehand. 
            The interpreter processes the JavaScript code and performs the actions described in the code immediately, 
            which allows for dynamic and interactive web pages.
